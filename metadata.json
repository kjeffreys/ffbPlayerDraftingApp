  "prompt": "I want a draft application that will start with a players.json with all the data needed beforehand for adp, expected points per game, team, name, unique id, or any other needed data. I guess tell me what data we will need and create an initial players.json for it and I'll update it with more. We want to draft a fast working app with great UI and UX. The players should be sortable by ADP, or VOR (value over replacement), both from the json file. It should be possible to see all players, or players by position (QB, RB, WR, FLEX (RB/WR), TE, K, DEF). I would like part of the usefulness of the UI / UX to be best in industry style colors and contracts of the different elements on each player bubble with their corresponding numbers, color differentiation of position. We need to not lose context when switching between position views or sorting views. I also would like some view for being able to track how many players we have tallied for each week for byes to prevent drafting too many players with the same bye week. But that is a separate view to prevent information overload. I also would like some kind of warning indicator where if the vor dropoff at a position for a player within the next 30 players is greater than all other positions by more than 5%, whatever the icon is to indicate the danger of not drafting that player because the next player at that position by VOR is a huge dropoff compared to other positions.
